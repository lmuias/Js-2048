# Game 2048
# Description
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic game 2048. The game is built using JavaScript and is designed to be played directly in the browser.

# How to Play
Objective: The goal of the game is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048.

# Controls:

# Arrow Keys: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move all tiles in the grid in one direction. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.
Start/Restart Button: Click on the "Start" button to begin the game. During the game, this button changes to "Restart" to allow restarting the game.
Game Over:

# Win Condition: You win the game when you successfully create a tile with the number 2048.
Lose Condition: The game ends when there are no possible moves left (i.e., no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same number that can merge).
# Features
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score, which increases as you merge tiles.
Restart Capability: You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.
Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Keyboard Controls: In addition to the button controls, you can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to play the game.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: The core logic of the game is written in JavaScript.
HTML/CSS: Basic structure and styling are handled using HTML and CSS.
Event Handling: Event listeners are used to capture user input (button clicks and keyboard strokes).
Game Logic: The game logic involves tile movement, merging, and checking game status (playing, win, lose).
Installation
There is no specific installation required to play the game. Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to start playing.
